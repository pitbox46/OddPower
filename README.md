# Odd Power

Odd power is meant to be a simple mod that adds a handful of non-conventional ways to generate Minecraft power. 

Current features include:
- Dummy that mobs attack
- Dummy Generator that creates power every time the dummy above it dies
- Explosion Generator that creates power when an explosion occurs (has a cooldown)

### Planned Features

- Config to change generator values
- Tooltips for generator items that display the amount of power that each one is holding
- Generator that takes trash and turns it into power (possibly also waste that cannot be used for anything?)
